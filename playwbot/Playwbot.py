        there is no (easy) way to do that in RF.

        Since RobotFramework does not support passing keywords as arguments
        to other keywords (essentialy that is passing a <Callable> type as an argument),
        we are doing a bit of trick.

        You have to specify the action, which triggers the awaited request, by assigned name.

        Currently, supported actions are:

        - Go To -> "go to"

        You have to also specify, if needed, `action_args` keyword argument options, which may contain:

        - <list> of args to be unpacked for *args
        - <dict> of kwargs to be unpacked for **kwargs
